# üöó Arduino WiFi Car Controller

## Overview
Welcome to the Arduino WiFi Car Controller project! This project allows you to control a car remotely over WiFi using an Arduino and a mobile app, providing an interactive and fun IoT application.


## Components Used
- üöô **Arduino UNO**: Microcontroller for car control and sensor integration.
- üì∂ **ESP8266 WiFi Module**: Enables wireless communication for IoT connectivity.
- üì± **Mobile App**: Provides the interface for remote control (e.g., Blynk app).
- üïπÔ∏è **Motor Driver**: Controls the movement of the car motors.
- üîã **Battery Pack**: Powers the Arduino and motors for mobility.

## Project Description
### Arduino UNO
- Acts as the main controller for the car, receiving commands from the mobile app via WiFi.

### ESP8266 WiFi Module
- Facilitates communication between the Arduino and the mobile app over a WiFi network.

### Mobile App (e.g., Blynk)
- Provides a user-friendly interface to control the car's movement remotely (forward, backward, left, right).

### Motor Driver
- Controls the motors (DC or stepper) based on commands received from the Arduino.

### Battery Pack
- Provides portable power supply for the Arduino and motors, ensuring mobility.

## Setup and Installation
### Hardware Setup
1. Connect Arduino UNO to ESP8266 WiFi module.
2. Connect Motor Driver to Arduino for controlling motors.
3. Power the setup using the battery pack for mobility.

### Software Setup
1. Install Arduino IDE and necessary libraries.
2. Configure WiFi credentials and Blynk app for remote control.
3. Upload the provided sketch to Arduino UNO.

## Usage
- Connect the Arduino to the mobile app via WiFi.
- Use the mobile app controls to maneuver the car (forward, backward, left, right).
- Explore additional features like camera integration or obstacle detection for enhanced functionality.
